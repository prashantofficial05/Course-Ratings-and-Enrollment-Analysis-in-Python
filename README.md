### Course Ratings and Enrollment Analysis in Python

**Introduction:**

   A detailed analysis of course ratings and enrollment patterns across different course types, 
   difficulty levels, and institutions. The project explores relationships between course 
   popularity and ratings, identifies key trends, and provides actionable insights for improving 
   online course offerings.
  
**Goal:**
   To evaluate the factors influencing course ratings and enrollment, identify trends and 
   outliers, and provide recommendations for optimizing course design and delivery.

**Description:**
   - **Define Scope:** Focus on analyzing course ratings and enrollments to identify patterns 
        based on certificate types, difficulty levels, and institutions.
   - **Data Collection:** Utilize sample datasets representing online course platforms with 
       details like course ratings, student enrollment, course difficulty, and certificate types.
   - **Data Analysis:** Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights such as rating 
       distributions, enrollment trends, and potential correlations.
   - **Insights Generation:** Identify key trends such as rating variability, enrollment clusters, 
       and outliers.
   - **Visualization:** Use graphs and plots to visualize the relationship between enrollment 
       numbers and course ratings.
     
**Skills:**
   - Python for data preprocessing, EDA, and statistical analysis.
   - Pandas and NumPy for handling large datasets efficiently.
   - Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
   - Data storytelling to communicate key insights effectively.
     
**Metrics:**
   - Median ratings by course type and difficulty.
   - Rating distribution across different enrollment ranges.
   - Identification of outliers in course ratings and enrollments.
   - Trends in course popularity and student preferences.

**Summary:**
   This project highlights trends and patterns in course ratings and enrollments, providing 
   insights into factors influencing course popularity. It helps online learning platforms 
   identify opportunities for improvement and better cater to student preferences.

**Next Steps:**
   - Explore additional factors such as instructor ratings or course duration for deeper insights.
   - Implement machine learning models to predict future ratings based on course attributes.
   - Expand analysis by incorporating user feedback and reviews for qualitative insights.
